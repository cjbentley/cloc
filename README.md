# cloc - count lines of code
A simple program that counts lines of code. Or any kind of text, really.

I quickly threw together this program to compare a bunch of files on my drive. The --scriptfriendly flag makes it nice and easy for other programs to make decisions based on cloc's output (for example, you could sort files based on lines of code or something) and running it without --scriptfriendly makes it easier to parse if you're trying to run it yourself.
